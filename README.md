XDATA Financial Event Analysis Tool

The Financial Event Analysis Tool (FEAT) aids analysts in constructing timeline analyses of financial market events that have been correlated with external market-manipulating factors such as SPAM emails, social media discussions, and news releases using a familiar market activity and event dashboard.  FEAT provides analyses across a wide variety of data time scales and across a range of external factors, allowing for example, an analyst to contextualize and aggregate individual quotes, transactions, and market-manipulating factors over timelines ranging from days to months.  In addition, FEAT provides a testbed for financial anomaly detection algorithms and an integration platform for initiating and querying targeted crawls of external market factors. 

This is one of several open source projects sponsored by XDATA and Continuum Analytics.  Please [visit our website](https://www.continuum.io/open-source-core-modern-software) to learn more about open source development at Continuum.
